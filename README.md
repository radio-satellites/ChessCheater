## Backstory

I needed to beat my brother at chess. 

Problem: I am bad at chess. 

So why invest time in learning and practicing chess puzzles? Let's just write 400-something lines of code to make this work...

### Hardware
The firmware runs on an Adafruit MagTag. This is currently out of stock on the Adafruit store, however I had around for years and never really did anything proper with it. 

The only extra hardware required is some sort of battery pack. I didn't have any (usable) LiPos, so I used two 2xAA battery packs plugged together to make 6V. The theoretical maximum is 10v for the input, so 6v is fine.
